# DSA Practice Project

A TypeScript-based project for learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms and DSA concepts to help you understand fundamental computer science concepts.

## 🎯 What is this project?

This is my personal practice project where I implement and learn different algorithms and data structures. It's designed for:
- **Learning DSA concepts** through hands-on coding
- **Understanding algorithm complexity** and performance
- **Practicing TypeScript** while solving algorithmic problems
- **Building a reference** for common sorting algorithms

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd practice
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 📚 Available Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Selection Sort** - `npm run selectionSort`
- **Bubble Sort** - `npm run bubbleSort`
- **Quick Sort** - `npm run quickSort`
- **Merge Sort** - `npm run mergeSort`

### Search Algorithms
- **Binary Search** - `npm run binarySearch`
- **Linear Search** - `npm run linearSearch`

### Other Algorithms
- **Fibonacci** - `npm run fibonacci`
- **Factorial** - `npm run factorial`

## 🎮 How to Run

### Run a specific algorithm:
```bash
# Run selection sort examples
npm run selectionSort

# Run bubble sort examples
npm run bubbleSort

# Run quick sort examples
npm run quickSort
```

### Development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Learning Goals

Through this project, I'm learning:
- How different sorting algorithms work
- Time and space complexity analysis
- TypeScript best practices
- Algorithm optimization techniques
- Problem-solving approaches

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a learning project, but if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to:
1. Open an issue
2. Submit a pull request
3. Share your own implementations

## 📝 Notes

- All implementations are in TypeScript for type safety
- Each algorithm includes examples and test cases
- Focus is on understanding rather than production optimization
- Perfect for DSA interview preparation
